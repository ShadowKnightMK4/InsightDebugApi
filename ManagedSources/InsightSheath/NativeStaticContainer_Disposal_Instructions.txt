	The goal of the NativeStaticContainer is hold one unmanaged pointer and be subclassed as needed. It's widely 
    used throughout this project. This does follow  a small difference from normal disposal() guidelines.


GUIDELINES for using NativeStaticContainer.

You're going to need to be answer able these questions:

#1 Can the unmanaged memory block can safely be cleaned up via C/C++'s free()?
	-> If it needs something more than a single call to free it (for example native pointer is a c++ class or COM object) then
       you're going to need to override the protected disposal as it looks to a call to C/C++'s free() if the native pointer
       if not zero.
#2 Is my subclassed class going to be further subclassed?
	-> We will need to be defensive in not calling our unmanaged cleanup routine if already done.
#3 Is my subclass handing out new instances of classes pointing to the same unmanaged memory as my main subclass.
	-> If this is the case. You need to Be subclassed from ReferenceCounterNativeStatic instead.
