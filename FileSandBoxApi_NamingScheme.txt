This file describes how the naming scheme is Done.



Most of the public facing routines will have an Internal varient. Let's consider an example.

FSContinueDebugEvent() is exported in the model def file. 
FSContinueDebugEventInternal()  is not exported.


FSContinueDebugEventInternal() implements the logic for the FSContinueDebugEvent().
FSContinueDebugEvent() takes a DWORD instead of the client structure and resolves that to an index contained within a DLL before calling FSContinueDebugEventInternal()



Library Usage
Call FSStatup() to grab an ID for your app to use.     This is an index to a client* structure.
Call FSCleanup() when you are done.
