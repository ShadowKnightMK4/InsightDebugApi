Project Name and Scope:

Project “Insight”/ “InsightDebugAPI” is named after the concept in the Bloodborne 
video game called Insight where the more insight one has the more ‘mad’ the character 
was. Scope of project primarily is spawning processes to debug / load telemetry DLLs
into them and extract info from them. The Debugger code is also there to let the user 
debug unmanaged code from .NET side. There’s no current plan to add support for 
attaching to already running processes.  


Documentation Goals:
Minimum
	The public facing C# Routines in the Sheath have documentation and are from the 
	perspective of a user that does not deal with Unmanaged Code. The C Level Wrappers
	have documentation.

Stretch
	Internal Routines on the C# Side also have documentation.
	The C/C++ Code in InsightAPI have full documentation for every routine.
