This is a quick start for beginning to use the library.
For C#, you're going to need to pick if you target x86 or x64 rather than Any - for now.
For Native, either library is good.

Files to include:
	FileSandboxApi.dll			<- this is the library
	FileSandboxSheath.dll		<- this is the c# wrapper


On the Manged/Sheath class size
->	ThreadContext		<- read and write information on threads.   Not directly tied to the lib as you can suppply your own handle and thread if
						<- has a native side queivelent.
->  InsightHunter		<-  Class for dealing with and processing symbols with the debug help symbol engine
						<-  Tired closely with PsProcessInformation
						<- has a natie side equivelent
-> PsProcessInformation <- Spawn processes and modify how they are setup.
						<- Optionally get debug event data from them.
						<- manly intended for spawning processes to debug.



The Design goal of the Sheath is to be as minimal wrapper as feasibly possible while taking a bit of advantage of C#'s GC scheme.
